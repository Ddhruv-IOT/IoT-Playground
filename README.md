# IoT-Playground

Welcome to the IoT-Playground repository! Here, you'll find a collection of codes developed for learning, research, and optimization purposes. This repository contains code written in C, C++, Arduino IDE-supported C, and Python, with a focus on smart systems, automation systems, IoT-controlled devices, and a wide array of sensors and electronic components.

## About Me

I am passionate about creating innovative solutions for smart homes, life automation, and IoT-controlled systems. My projects involve various hardware platforms such as Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and a diverse range of sensors like PIR, IR, IR Receivers, temperature sensors, ultrasonics, and a plethora of electronics including relays, MOSFETs, transistors, and more.

My work also extends to optimizing Arduino and embedded codes, connecting devices to voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home, and seamlessly integrating Python when required.
